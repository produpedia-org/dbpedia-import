Expect proper documentation and a clear import workflow some time later this year. Until then, everything here is subject to utter change

These `.coffee` files are Coffeescript files to be run with Deno. The only way to do this right now is something along the lines of... (taken from the head of `mapping_generator.coffee`)
```
e.g. (after `yarn install coffeescript`): `yarn run coffee -c -b *.coffee && deno mapping_generator.js`
Just like Python, just cooler.
probably deno will be able to read/compile coffeescript files natively at some point so this will be only
`deno mapping_generator.coffee` but this doesnt work yet
```
You will also find a first large mapping file. Mapping files define which DBpedia predicates are considered relevant, defining for this class or irrelevant. The predicates are also partly mapped to each other and provided with meta infos like unit or name. This is also highly experimental and will probably move to another repository later on. You can, however, already see the results at https://produpedia.org/p/Smartphone.
